Elon Musk,@elonmusk,2022-05-14T23:04:15.000Z,"Very important to fix your Twitter feed:

1. Tap home button.
2. Tap stars on upper right of screen.
3. Select “Latest tweets”.

You are being manipulated by the algorithm in ways you don’t realize.

Easy to switch back & forth to see the difference."
Elon Musk,@elonmusk,2022-05-15T07:28:05.000Z,Not to mention potential bugs in the code. Open source is the way to go to solve both trust and efficacy.
Elon Musk,@elonmusk,2022-05-15T07:23:13.000Z,"I’m not suggesting malice in the algorithm, but rather that it’s trying to guess what you might want to read and, in doing so, inadvertently manipulate/amplify your viewpoints without you realizing this is happening"

Depending on production date, power increase power may be >50% at 30C ambient temp."
Elon Musk,@elonmusk,2021-04-22T01:51:09.000Z,"Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter & house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install & seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts."
